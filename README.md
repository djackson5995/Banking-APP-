# Banking Application
This is a simple Python program that simulates a banking system, allowing users to manage their accounts, perform transactions, and apply interest.

## How It Works
The program provides a console-based interface and prompts the user to:

1. Open a New Account: Enter personal details to create a new bank account.
2. Deposit Money: Enter the amount to deposit into an account.
3. Withdraw Money: Enter the amount to withdraw from an account, ensuring sufficient funds are available.
4. Transfer Money: Transfer funds between two accounts within the bank.
5. Change Account PIN: Update the PIN associated with an account for security purposes.
6. Apply Interest: Apply a specified annual interest rate to all accounts, compounded monthly.
7. ATM Withdrawals: Perform cash withdrawals with specific denominations.
8. Deposit Change: Deposit various coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters) into an account.
9. Close an Account: Remove an account from the bankâ€™s records.
   
It calculates:

- Account balances after deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Interest application based on the provided annual rate.
- New account details after changing the PIN or closing an account.
